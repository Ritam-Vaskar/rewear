# 👚 ReWear – Community Clothing Exchange

[Problem Statement 📄](https://github.com/Ritam-Vaskar/rewear.git)

## 🌿 Overview

**ReWear** is a web-based platform that enables users to **exchange unused clothing** through **direct swaps** or a **point-based redemption system**. Our mission is to promote **sustainable fashion** and reduce **textile waste** by encouraging users to reuse wearable garments instead of discarding them.

Built using the **MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)** and deployed on **Vercel**, ReWear offers a smooth, interactive, and community-driven way to give your clothes a second life.
